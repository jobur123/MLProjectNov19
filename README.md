## Maching Learning and Statistics Project - GMIT November 2019

This project is an Analysis of the Boston House Prices dataset.
<br>It contains 3 sections:
  1. A descritption of the dataset (Using descriptive statistics and plots).
  2. An analysis using inferential statistics as to whether there is a significant difference <br>in median house prices between those on the Charles river and those that aren't.
  3. A neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.
  
The project contains a single jupyter notebook called `'Boston House Prices.ipynb` and this README.md file.
  
To run the notebook, you have two options:
  1. Use nbviewer:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and put URL of file in your repository in the textfield as shown. Press Go button to view the notebook.
  2. Have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) locally installed on your machine: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reccomend to install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution. Instructions for you OS will be found in the downloads section of the anaconda site. Jupyter comes as part of this install.
  
 

To run the notebook, you must have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install this using the Anaconda Python distribution.
